hist(choco$CocoaPercent)

"CocoaPercent has a middle-skew distribution with few outliers in the 100 cocoa percent."
x<- table(choco$Rating, choco$CountryBeanOrigin)
barplot(x, las=3,space=5)
"chocolate made in south america is more likely to have a higher rating."

y <- table(choco$Rating, choco$CocoaPercent)
barplot(y)
summary(choco)
str(choco$CocoaPercent)
"Yes, ratings do depend on the cocoa percent. When cocoa percent is between 70-75% it is more likely to receive a higher rating."

origin <- table(choco$Characteristics1, choco$SpecificBeanOrigin)
summary(origin)
"South American cocoa beans are more likely to be richer"
"Beans from places like the South America are better because they have higher ratings due to the findings in the barplot found in the previous questions."


"1. The first analysis I would like to see is if the rating of cocoa beans are higher now then they were in the past."

now <- table(choco$Rating, choco$ReviewDate)
barplot(now)
cor(now)
"No the rating of the cocoa beans are not higher/ there is no obvious correlation between rating and review date"

"2. The second analysis I would like to see is if the cocoa percent depends on the country bean origin."

dep <- table(choco$CocoaPercent, choco$CountryBeanOrigin)
cor(dep)
barplot(dep, las=3)

"There is also no real correclation between country bean origin and cocoa percent most countries have an equal amount of each category respectively"
